					<b>A REFUGEE FAMILY FROM SUDAN </b>- Hanan and her family hail from the Nuba Mountains, an extraordinary isolated area in northern Sudan that has been torn by war for close to 50 years because of their allengence to people in the south. Many of the Nuba people groups are thought to be descendants of great Nubian Kingdoms, including Kush and Mero.	
					<br><br>
					Political instability caused Hanan and her husband to locate to Kenya several years ago.  When he abandoned the family Hanan became a single mother with three children. She would later “adopt” a fourth child after the death of her sister. On many occasions Hanan also offers hospitality to new refugees who do not have a place to stay or food to eat.
					<br><br>
					Her status as a refuge, lack of formal education and limited English skills restrict Hanan’s job prospects to “live in” positions. But the family resides in an unsafe neighborhood so she is understandably reluctant to leave her children alone at night. As a result the family has had to rely on the generosity of friends and sponsors in addition to support from the Nuba Relief, Rehabilitation and Development organization (NRRDO). 
					<br><br>
					Hanan requests prayers for her children and herself. Two of her children currently attend a secondary missionary school and the other two are currently enrolled in junior primary school.  Hanan has also returned to school to improve her English in order to get a decent job that will allow her to be home in the evenings and support family members who still live in the Nuba Mountains. School fees range from $500 - $2500 per term. 
					<br><br>
					At today’s exchange rate, school fees and books for the 17 year old is approximately $2500 per year; $1300 for the 15 year old; and $1200 each for the 11 and 9 year olds. Hanan also needs at least 3 more semesters of English language classes at a cost of $ 500 - $ 700 per semester.
