					HISTORY

				<p>
					Sylvia Wilson, the founding director of WAY has extensive experience the social service arena in addition to having lived and worked in Kenya. While there she collaborated with nationals to coordinate activities for American visitors and supervise volunteers from several countries. That experience convinced her that there was a need for a different way to build relationship across boundaries of race, class, ethnicities and nationalities.

					In 2004 WAY was incorporated as a non-profit educational organization and received itâ€™s 501(C)(3) designation. Since then Sylvia and her Associates have served as advisors and/or tour organizers for individuals, families, college students, church groups and other non-profits traveling to the continent.

					Sylvia Wilson is an ordained Presbyterian minister whose primary mission in life is to introduce others to the Africa she has come to know and love.
