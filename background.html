					BACKGROUND
				</header>

				<div class="sub-header" style="background-size: 102px 28px;">
					HISTORY
				</div>
				<p>
					Sylvia Wilson, Founding Director of Wilson AnthonY, Inc. (WAY) has lived and worked in Kenya and spent time in other parts of Africa, including Tanzania, Uganda, Ethiopia and the Sudan. She also has extensive travel experience in the USA, South America, the Caribbean and Europe.  
					<br><br>
					In Kenya Sylvia was responsible for coordinating groups of American visitors and supervising volunteers from several countries. That experience convinced her that there was a need for a different way to build relationship across boundaries of race, class, ethnicities and nationalities.
					<br><br>
					The thought became a reality in 2004 when WAY was incorporated as a non-profit educational organization. Since that time Sylvia has served as advisor and/or tour organizer for individuals, families, college students, church groups and other non-profits traveling to the continent.
					<br><br>
					Sylvia Wilson is an ordained Presbyterian minister whose primary mission in life is to introduce others to the Africa she has come to know and love.
