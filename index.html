				    Welcome to the new WAY website and a new WAY to engage in healthy, respectful, mutually rewarding cross-cultural relationships. While you are here we hope you discover new ways to engage with people and groups from cultures and countries that differ from your own.					
				    <br><br>
					WAY is a small educational non-profit organization. Since 2004, WAY has sought to strengthen bridges of understanding between Americans and East Africans as well as between diverse groups of people in the USA. 
					<br><br>
					That idea became a reality in 2004 when WAY officially became a 501 (c) (3) non-profit organization. Since that time Sylvia has served as advisor and/or tour organizer for individuals, families, church groups and non-profit organizations traveling to the continent.
					<br><br>
					We welcome the opportunity to serve each and every one of you.
